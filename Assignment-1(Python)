## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Python is called general purpose because it can be used to create a variety of different programs but it is not specialized for any specific problem.
     It is call high level because it is written in human readable language which is translated to machine level language by the interpretor/compiler.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans:It is called dynamically typed because the variable type is determined during the run time.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans:Pros: Extensive libraries , Beginner - friendly , large community.
    Cons:Python is dynamically typed, slower then compiled languages.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans:Machine learning , Big data , AI.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans : Variables are name of memory storage , we declare variable in python during initialization.

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans:input() function is used.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans : String datatype.

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: The process of converting one datatype into other.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: We can take multiple input from single input function using .split() method.
     e.g-> a, b, c = input("Enter three values: ").split()  

Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Keywords are reserved words in python programming which cannot be used for general purpose but for those specific purpose.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No we cant use keyword as variable because those are reserved word which have predefined meaning.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: It refers to the spaces at the begining of code line, python use identation to indicate a block of code.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: Using print() method.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Add (+) , substract(-) , multipy(*) , division (/) , modulus(%),power(**) etc.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: With single / we get the decimal part also after division but with // the decimal part is skipped from the result.

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: print('''```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```'''
)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Ans:
def even_odd(num):
    print(type(num))
    if(num%2 == 0):
        print("The number ",num," is EVEN")

    else:
        print("The number ",num," is ODD") 


print("Please enter the number")
a=int(input())
even_odd(a)     
    

   

Q18. What are boolean operator?

Ans: Operator which return true or false. E.g -> and , or and not.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 --> 1

0 and 0 --> 0

True and False and True --> False

1 or 0 or 0 --> 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Ans: Those statement which decides if a block of code will be executed or not . E.g - > if statement.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: 'if' - > It check the condition when its satisfied then it execudes the corresponding code written under it.
     'elif'-> It is executed when the if condition prior to it was not satisfied.
     'else'-> When  the if,elif condition are not satisfied then finally else condition is executed.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans:
def vote(age):
    if(age>=18):
        print("I can Vote")

    else:
        print("I can't vote")

print("Please Enter you age")
age=int(input())
vote(age)   

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: 
def even_list(list):
    list_final = []
    for num in list:
        if(num%2==0):
            list_final.append(num)
    return list_final       



numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
a=even_list(numbers)
print(a)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans:
def gretest_number(a,b,c):
    num=a
    if(b>num):
        num=b
        if(c>num):
            num=c
    elif(c>num):
        num=c
    return num    


a,b,c=input("Enter three numbers:").split(",")
print("Greatest num is:",gretest_number(a, b, c))

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
def unique_num(input_list):
    new_list=[]
    for i in input_list:
        if(i>500):
            break
        elif(i>150):
            continue
        elif(i%5==0):
            new_list.append(i)
    return new_list            
    
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
print("The required result is:",unique_num(numbers))
